# note-taker-repository

## Description
This application is designed to be a note taker that allows user to write and save notes to the website. While most of what you see was created using HTML and CSS, the application relies heavily on the back end using Express.js to retrieve data. I was inspired to make this application to allow users to save notes so they can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.  

## Installation

To open this environment, here are the steps needed:

1. Open Terminal
2. Make a new directory titled "note-taker-repository" (ensure you are in the location on your computer where you want the repo to be)
3. In GitHub, click the green 'Code' button and copy the HTTPS link
4. In Terminal, type "git clone" then paste the copied link and hit enter
5. Once cloned, check the status of the cloning by navigating to the directory where the repo is located and typing "git status"
6. If green, then the repo has been cloned and you can then drag the folder from your computer into vscode to run the environment

Alternative Steps:

1. Follow the link to my Github repository link
2. Once there, scroll down to "Environments" on the right hand side of the screen
3. Click the Heroku link to open the deployed application

## Usage 
You may use this to write and save notes that will be dynamically updated on the webpage.
